    * **Note:** If the correct information is not in these fields or the fields are blank, reach out to the scale supervisor.
3. In the Vehicle field, enter **WGH**.
4. In the Bill-to field, enter the **4-digit code** for the billing company listed on the load’s BOL (Bill of Lading).
    * If the code is unknown, click the **magnifying glass** icon to the right of the Bill-to field to open the search window.
        1. In the Name field, enter the first three or four letters of the company’s name.
        2. Press **tab**. This begins the search and highlight the first search option that starts with those letters.
